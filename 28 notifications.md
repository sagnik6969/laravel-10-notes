##                Sending Notifications in laravel

Yeas, with this cool feature of laravel wÃ© can send notifications to our users also.
notifications including variety of channels like - gmail, slack etc


create cmd- `php artisan make:notification NotificationName`
location- App\Notifications\NotificationName.php





{{


use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;

class UserNotification extends Notification
{
    use Queueable;
    
    // Laravel notifications uses this queable trait by default why?
    // Because laravel send the notification asyncronously that means send mail in a related time not immediately because sending notifications is a quiet big task that consumes more time and if it will be executed syncronously then there may be a chance of execution blockage of our php script. 
    //  Now someone has to manage this asyncronous jobs in backend because php is focusing on executing the php script right now, so queue works this for us.



    //  Mention the platform which we wants to use : 'mail', 'database', 'broadcast', 'vonage' and 'slack'

    // mail -> Email
    // database -> Stores the content in a log file/table
    // broadcast -> Used in Web sockets when we need to broadcast a message
    // vonage, slack -> popular messaging apps

    public function via(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return ['mail'];
    }

    
}

}}






# Send Notifications 

We can send notifications in two ways:

1. Using Notifiable Trait
{{
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;        // Trait imported
 
REMARK: Make sure you have included notifiable trait in your respective model.

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;                           // Trait applied
}


`Now for each user instance a new method is available named` notify() ` that on called send the notification to the respective user`

use App\Notifications\NotificationName;
 
$user->notify(new NotificationName( $instance ));


}}


2. Using Facades

{{
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;
    use App\Notifications\NotificationName;
    
    Notification::send( $users, new NotificationName() );
}}

# ----> notification via mail

{{
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
            ->line('Reminder: you have an upcoming event')
            ->action('View Event', route('events.show', ['event' => $this->event->id]))
            ->line("The event {$this->event->name} starts at {$this->event->start_time}");
    }
}}
